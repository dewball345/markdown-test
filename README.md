## What is markdown?


According to wikipedia, 
> Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form.[9] Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files

## Things i like about markdown?

* Its very nice, you know(and there's no learning curve and its meant for everyone)
* With the simplicity of google docs and the numerous themes, one can name a website easily!

ex:

HTML code:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p> This is HTML </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Markdown:
```
# Hello World!
This is markdown
```
* Perfect for blogs

Easier to read, so development will be similar to writing a book than coding!
